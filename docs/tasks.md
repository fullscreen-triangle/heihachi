# Heihachi Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvement tasks for the Heihachi audio analysis framework. Each task is actionable and should be checked off when completed.

## Code Quality and Organization

1. [x] Fix code duplication in `src/core/pipeline.py` - the class is defined twice and the `process` method appears twice
2. [x] Fix duplicate content in `src/cli/__init__.py` - the same docstring and imports appear twice
3. [ ] Standardize import patterns across all modules (absolute vs. relative imports)
4. [ ] Implement consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase
5. [x] Add type hints to all functions and methods
6. [x] Refactor long methods in `pipeline.py` (e.g., `_parallel_process`, `process`) into smaller, more focused functions
7. [x] Implement proper logging throughout the application with appropriate log levels
8. [x] Add docstrings to all classes and methods following a consistent format (e.g., Google style)
9. [x] Remove redundant code in path handling (multiple instances of sys.path manipulation)
10. [ ] Implement proper exception hierarchies for application-specific errors

## Performance Optimization

11. [x] Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks
12. [x] Optimize memory usage in the pipeline processing to reduce the need for garbage collection
13. [x] Improve parallel processing implementation in `_parallel_process` method
14. [x] Implement caching mechanisms for intermediate results to avoid redundant computations
15. [x] Optimize audio loading and preprocessing steps
16. [x] Implement batch processing optimizations for handling multiple files
17. [x] Add progress reporting for long-running operations
18. [x] Optimize visualization generation for large audio files
19. [x] Implement lazy loading for resource-intensive components
